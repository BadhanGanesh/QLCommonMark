# QLCommonMark

## Introduction

`QLCommonMark` is a QuickLook generator for [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/) and Markdown files.  It uses [cmark](https://github.com/jgm/cmark) to render the text, and Bootstrap to style it.

## Installation

[Download `QLCommonMark.qlgenerator`](https://github.com/digitalmoksha/QLCommonMark/releases/download/v1.1/QLCommonMark.qlgenerator.zip) and copy it to your `~/Library/QuickLook` or `/Library/QuickLook` folder.  If the plugin is not picked up immediately, you may need to run `qlmanage -r` from the Terminal.
